# Vendor and Products App

## Description
- Engineered a sophisticated user interface allowing users to interact with vendor and product data seamlessly, including functionalities to add, update, and delete records with built-in confirmation protocols to prevent accidental data loss.
- Created a responsive QR code panel within the application that allows users to visually verify QR codes directly from the interface, improving user interaction and data accuracy.
- Ensured robust application performance and user experience by conducting extensive testing, including a specific focus on the ViewController functionalities to guarantee accurate data rendering and updates across different user sessions.

## Features
- Developed dynamic forms for adding and updating vendor details and associated products, with fields for comprehensive information such as contact details, address, and product specifications including pricing and inventory levels.
- Integrated QR code generation and decoding functionality for products and purchase orders, enhancing product traceability and verification processes through external tools like zxing.org.
- Implemented complex business logic to handle product quantities and reordering points (ROP), economic order quantities (EOQ), and to display real-time inventory and order updates.

- Facilitated the generation and viewing of purchase orders in both the application interface and in downloadable PDF format, incorporating QR codes for easy scanning and verification.
